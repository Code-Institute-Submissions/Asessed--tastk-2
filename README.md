# Moons of Uranus 
*This site was created for two reasons, to understand the basics of a data dashboard and to teach the reader about something that they wouldnt normally come about in their day to day life. <br />
*I have aimed to di this in such a way that with no prior knowlage to what the site is for, as if it just popped up on your screen you wuld almost instantly know what the site showed and how it did so. <br />
*Making the site interactable is also a way to get a level of education in without just reading a static page, the more memorable and personalised the experiance is then the more information youre likely to remember.

## UX
*As listed above I want to make this process as easy as possible for the user, the last thing you want is to go into a site and have to spend the first few moments working out what youre looking at so that was the main aim. Limit complications and have people assured that if theyre on a site created by you then they will not be asking what is going on. <br />
*This site was created for anyone who wants to gently expand their knowlage, I personally have an intrest in space but the information is always the same as its always about the Earth or what we have acchived, so I wanted people that did (or diddnt) have an intrest in space to be able to come to this site and learn something diffrent then what is in the main spotlight for space new.

## Features
*In terms of features the site only has a few but this is in no way resitricting as it still impliments everything it was designed to do. <br />
*The features are that the site is interactible using the d3 mechanic, this means that if you click on the graph the rest of the site will turn specific and only load the data relivent to what you have clicked. This is the case for all of the graphs. <br />
*The feature gives the user a personalised feel with the site, as soon as they click and interact that site is then customised to them which I belive to make the user feel that way is a feature alone.

## Technology used 
*HTML- To display and render everything required. <br />
*CSS- To make the dark 'Space theme' for the site and alow everything to flow together. <br />
*JavaScript- To create the functions that allow these graphs to have been created, also to help create the model solar system in the footer. <br />
*D3/DC- Worked with the javascript to create the graphs and the model solar system. Also allowed the graphs to interact when clicked. 

## Testing
*The data type for this site had to be changed a few times as I would have ideas in my head that would not be possible when it came to implementing them. Sometimes This would not have been realised until I was testing the code. <br />
*This code was ran by myself and friends in multiple diffrent situations to bring the best possible UX on laptops and on mobiles to eliminate any potential bugs. <br />
*After many tests of diffrent types of data and many attemps of running it, I finally ended up with the site I am presting now. <br />

## Deployment 
*100% of this code was written in Cloud9 as I find it is easier to keep it all local in one place and I find the layout of Cloud9 to be benficial for both the code creator and the client. <br />
*The data was created in Excell then exported in a CSV file and locally stored in the code. <br />
*Github was where I commited the code in stages so that steps could be observed and any errors could be located with ease and progress could be easily monitered.

## Credit 
*I discovered my inspiration through SpaceX, a privatly owned space flight company who are looking into commercial space flight and as they are achiving somthing diffrent as everyone else, I wanted my dataset to be diffrent to everyone elses too. Hence the obscure angle. <br />
*My data was recived from a few diffrent sites as listed below; <br /> 
-https://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/exploring-the-planets/online/solar-system/uranus/moons.cfm <br />
-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moons_of_Uranus <br />
-https://www.space.com/22201-uranus-moons.html <br />
Even though these sites all display very simmilar information, I wanted to make sure my data was correct so I looked on multiple diffrent sites to ensure this was as accurate as I could make it.
